## AMP vs PWA... whats the difference?

AMP delivers pages almost in an instant for users browsing content on the mobile web, which is hugely important on limited or flaky networks. Progressive Web Apps deliver reliable performance for re-visits to sites thanks to Service Workers and allows unprecedented engagement via push notifications and Add To Homescreen.

AMP gets content in front of users fast – PWAs enable rich experiences and engagement. AMP is for the "leaf" nodes of your site, whereas PWA is for the "root".

Both work nicely together, and we're working on improving the story even further. The amp-install-serviceworker allows you to install a PWA app shell from your origin, so when a user clicks on a designated button near the end of an AMP article to engage more ("Want to read more?"), they immediately land on your full blown PWA, in an instant, and the PWA can even consume AMPs document within it, due to the main feature of AMPs – portability.

This only scratches the surface, but follow the AMP blog and stay tuned for better extended explanations.
